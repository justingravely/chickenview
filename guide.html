Progression

    What makes me maxed out and caught up for Endgame?

    -Gear
        -Exotic Gear
            -Soulbound pre-BiS
            -Good enough for all content besides high level fractals

        -Ascended Gear
            -Account Bound BiS
            -12.5% more damage than exotics

    -Specific Masteries
        -Some related to Strike & Fractal gold
        -Autoloot
        -Leyline Gliding
        The rest are optional as needed

    "Progression in GW2 is getting your pre-BiS or BiS for a specific build, Everything that comes after is cosmetic prestige, 
    This is why the game is so alt-friendly therefore it is understandable if you get bored as a one character andy. 

    Despite this, there are still many roles to fill where one character could have multiple sets of BiS gear for different reasons, like 2 PvE playstyles and 2 WvW playstyles."


Feeling Overwhelmed

    -Mastery level
        -Doesn't Matter, mostly optional stuff
    -Achievement Level/Rank
        -Doesn't Matter, mostly optional stuff
    -Achievement UI
        -The achievement panel itself can be mostly ignored. You can word search what specific "quest" you're doing then track it in the "questlog", 
        You can also type '/wiki (title)' for a walkthrough of any "quest" you're on.
    -Story Progress
        -Doesn't Matter, Optional ascended loot quests within
    -There's No Rush, Progress Stays Forever. 
    
    "You just choose a specific avenue of endgame that you enjoy and
     you can catch up and be the better than people who have played since launch in no time"

Endgame Options

    -Fractals = Heroic Dungeons
        Why? 
            1. Gold
            2. Ascended Gear
            3. Legendary Backpack

    -Raids = Raids
        Why?
            1. Legendary Armor
            2. Unique Skins
            3. Gold

    -Strikes = 10 player LFR
        Why?
            1. Gold
            2. Ascended Gear
        Has hard versions equal to raids

    -WvW = Open World PvP
        Why? 
            1. Transmog Charges
            2. All Gear Rarities
            3. Legendary Backpack/Ring


    "These are the main forms of challenging endgame. You can pretty much pick any and they each have their own prestige rewards in some form or another on top of 
    just being fun to do and perform well in (subjective of course). I did not include 5v5 sPvP because that's depressing blue dream xgames sweat that Hailey and I don't touch.
    Fractals can also be ignored at this point unless you want the legendary backpack eventually. We just do Strikes and Raids for a constant chill Legion-esq experience with some WvW on the side"


Gold Making

    -Daily 
        -Strikes
        -Achievement Dailys
        -Pact Supply Agent Grab
        -Daily fish
        -Meta event(s)

    -Weekly
        Arborstone Vendor Legendary Currency

    -Consistant (Not reccomended unless it's fun or garter)
        -Meta train grinding
        -Fishing

    -Longterm
        -Selling unique item earned from map completion

    "Pretty much everyone in the game is constantly thinking about gold making, it's the lifeblood flow of playing the game.
    Unlike in WoW everything you do at endgame benefits you handsomely with gold when you have a chill time playing consistantly.
    It's probably obvious but Gold is useful for affording new builds, skins, and some stuff on the gemstore without spending real money etc etc. "

I logged in now what
    Pick One
        -Endgame Option
        -Daily/Weekly for Gold
        -Try a new Class or Build
        -Work On Longterm Quest if you have one

    "Endgame Option and 'Dailys/Weekly for Gold' have a lot of overlaps as I'm sure you can imagine.
    The Daily list under gold making is typically what Hailey and I do every day that we play.
    Afterwards we might pug raids, WvW, or just get off etc"

Bags Are Full

    - Sell all junk to merchants with the sell junk button
    - Salvage everything that's yellow/green/blue
        -Basic kit -> green/blue
        -Master kit -> yellow
    - Sell exotics to TP
    - Transfer weird stuff you aren't sure about onto a bank character for later

    "Inventory management is a major downside of GW2 since there is so much crap thrown at you constantly.
    The best thing to remember is most of it converts to gold, and the confusing stuff can just be banked to think about later"
        
The Fun Parts

    -In an instance
        -Doing Top/High DPS if you're a DPS/Support DPS
        -Keeping people up when you're a Healer
        -Doing mechanics correctly and carrying

    -Winning fights in WvW with a DPS meter

    -Perfecting your transmog

    -Unlocking a new mount for the first time

    -Getting a legendary or unique skin that took long term effort 

    "These are the things that have made me feel an actual sense of fun and satisfaction. Like many MMO's other stuff is
    just backrooms chores and it's made even more challenging to endure in GW2 since gearing isn't a slot machine disco like in every other RPG"
